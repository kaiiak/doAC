 *
 * Print a binary tree in an m*n 2D string array following these rules: 
 * 
 * 
 * The row number m should be equal to the height of the given binary tree.
 * The column number n should always be an odd number.
 * The root node's value (in string format) should be put in the exactly middle
 * of the first row it can be put. The column and the row where the root node
 * belongs will separate the rest space into two parts (left-bottom part and
 * right-bottom part). You should print the left subtree in the left-bottom
 * part and print the right subtree in the right-bottom part. The left-bottom
 * part and the right-bottom part should have the same size. Even if one
 * subtree is none while the other is not, you don't need to print anything for
 * the none subtree but still need to leave the space as large as that for the
 * other subtree. However, if two subtrees are none, then you don't need to
 * leave space for both of them. 
 * Each unused space should contain an empty string "".
 * Print the subtrees following the same rules.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input:
 * ⁠    1
 * ⁠   /
 * ⁠  2
 * Output:
 * [["", "1", ""],
 * ⁠["2", "", ""]]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input:
 * ⁠    1
 * ⁠   / \
 * ⁠  2   3
 * ⁠   \
 * ⁠    4
 * Output:
 * [["", "", "", "1", "", "", ""],
 * ⁠["", "2", "", "", "", "3", ""],
 * ⁠["", "", "4", "", "", "", ""]]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input:
 * ⁠     1
 * ⁠    / \
 * ⁠   2   5
 * ⁠  / 
 * ⁠ 3 
 * ⁠/ 
 * 4 
 * Output:
 * 
 * [["",  "",  "", "",  "", "", "", "1", "",  "",  "",  "",  "", "", ""]
 * ⁠["",  "",  "", "2", "", "", "", "",  "",  "",  "",  "5", "", "", ""]
 * ⁠["",  "3", "", "",  "", "", "", "",  "",  "",  "",  "",  "", "", ""]
 * ⁠["4", "",  "", "",  "", "", "", "",  "",  "",  "",  "",  "", "", ""]]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * The height of binary tree is in the range of [1, 10].
